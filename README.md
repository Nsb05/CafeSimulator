# CafeSimulator
Hi, this is a beginner level project/prototype about a digital cafe simulator with dynamic features

🔹 Enhancements to Make It an Intermediate-Level Project

1️⃣ Better Seat Reservation System
✅ Implement persistent seat reservations (e.g., store reservations in a file or database so they are saved between program runs).
✅ Add a cancel reservation option.

2️⃣ Improved Jukebox System
✅ Allow users to add custom songs dynamically (by choosing files).
✅ Implement a playlist system instead of just playing one song at a time.
✅ Add a volume control and pause/resume features.

3️⃣ Cafe Membership System (Patron System)
✅ Implement a patron registration system where users can register with a name and ID.
✅ Store loyalty points for frequent customers.

4️⃣ Order Management System
✅ Allow users to order multiple items and display a receipt with the total price.
✅ Add a payment system (cash, card, or digital payment simulation).
✅ Implement inventory management (e.g., track stock for food items).

5️⃣ Graphical User Interface (GUI)
✅ Instead of a console-based menu, use Swing or JavaFX to create a full GUI-based cafe simulation.
✅ Show seat availability in a visual table layout instead of text output.
✅ Display the cafe menu with images.

6️⃣ Multithreading & Background Features
✅ Allow background music to play while users interact with other parts of the program.
✅ Use multithreading to handle multiple customer orders and seat reservations at once.
